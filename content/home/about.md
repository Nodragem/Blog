_Hi, there!_

I am French and living in Wales for 7.5 years now. I came here to do a PhD in Psychology (Computational Neuroscience to be more precise). 

I always liked to create and learn new stuffs, and I decided that to make games was a good hobby to express my creativity, cause I could code, draw, do 3d art, animation and even start composing a little. 

I started to make a game in my free time during my PhD, **Catch the crown**. It all started as a "training playground frankestein game" where I would just learn stuffs from tutorials, adapt them and put them together into something I like. I came up with the main characters (named *prabbits*) while playing around with Aseprite.

One day, during a BBQ, I told my friends what I was doing in my free time, and they wanted to see the game. Thirty minutes later they were still playing and laughing. It was one of the most emotional moment of my life, I was like "f*** I, I made a gaaame!!". A year later or so, I felt that I needed more space for my creativity and, I decided to work part time to be able to develop games. I am now trading as **Nodragem Games**; which is the reflection of my last name :) !
