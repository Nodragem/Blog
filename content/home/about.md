# About

Hi, there! I am currently a Research Associate at Cardiff University where I develop bio-inspired neural networks that replicates human beharioral performances in action selection and decision making.

In my free time, I enjoy digital painting, composing music, programming video games and playing couch multiplayer games.

This website tries to gather a bit of everything I come up with.
