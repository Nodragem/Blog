_Hi, there!_

I am currently part-time data scientist at the Office for National Statistics (UK) and I am running *Nodragem Games* as a sole trader the rest of the time.

Before to start my own business, I was research associate at Cardiff University where I developped computational neural networks that replicates human behariours in motor decision making.

In this life, I was lacking creativity and an immediate impact on the world. When I make a game, I can paint, compose music, program, animate characters... Importantly, when I show it to a friend or potential client, I get an immediate feedback on whether they enjoy it or not.

One of my dream is to use the skills I gathered in Game Development, Psychology and Data Science to help predict mental diseases. Imagine yourself playing to monitor your health.

But for now, I am focusing on making games and I hope that you will enjoy them!
