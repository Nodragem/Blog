 - [What's New in the Free Version of Happy Dogfigths 0.2.0]({{< relref "/post/gamedev/notes_happy-dogfight_020.md" >}})

## Summary

This game is a multiplayer 2D dogfight game to play with friends (2-4 players) on a couch or online.

You are a prabbit (mix of rabbit and parrot) who wants to prove that they are the best pilot in their tribe by winning a series of intense dogfights.

The rules are:

- be the last prabbit standing to win a round

- win 5 rounds to win a tournament

- be killed by a bomb and you won't play the next round

- collect coins to buy more bullets and bombs

Make temporary alliances and plot against the tournament leader to avoid a premature defeat. Use your bombs wisely to send a player away for one round and dash to victory!
