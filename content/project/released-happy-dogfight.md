## Description

Happy Dogfight is a multiplayer 2D dogfight game to play with friends (2-4 players) on a couch or online.

You are a prabbit (mix of rabbit and parrot) who wants to prove that they are the best pilot in their tribe.

You will dive into explosive dogfights, blast your way to the podium in fast-paced rounds, and bomb your friends to kick them out the next round. 

Can you blow all your friends up at once to claim a **smashing victory**?
