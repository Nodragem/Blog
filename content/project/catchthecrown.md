## Summary

Catch The Crown is a multi-player arena platform game.
Four teenager Prabbits - half parrot / half rabbit creatures - are undertaking their "Coming-of-Age" ritual. They are spawned in an arena with a crown and a timer. Once the crown is picked up by a Prabbit, coins, diamonds and rubies appear across the level. Only the Prabbit with the crown can collect them. 

A competition starts between Prabbits to catch the crown and collect gold. When the timer ends, the richer Prabbit wins.

## Customization and Notes:

 - the preference files are in the folder `preference` and it can be modified to make the game windowed or fullscreen, change the name of the characters, or even use the keyboard as input.
 - the assets are accessible and can be modified, that means you can add new levels and change the animations or sounds if you wanted to,
 - I could not actually test the Mac / Linux version. Please let me now if the game does not run on your platform.
 - the zip files may be quite large as the packr library (used to distribute libGDX games) is crashing as soon as it is unable to delete a file in the JRE (the stuff to run Java on your PC).
